# firecrest-workflows

A simple async workflow engine for interfacing with [FirecREST](https://products.cscs.ch/firecrest/).

The workflow engine uses [pyfirecrest](https://github.com/eth-cscs/pyfirecrest)
to interface with the [REST API](https://firecrest-api.cscs.ch).


See also the <https://github.com/eth-cscs/firecrest> demo server.

## Aims

- Minimise the number of requests to the server
